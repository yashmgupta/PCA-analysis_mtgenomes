# PCA-analysis_mtgenomes


We are delighted to inform you about the release of our Python script specifically developed for conducting Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on mitochondrial DNA sequences. The script was devised as a component of a research endeavour aimed at examining the fundamental organisation of entire mitochondrial genomes.KMeans clustering was used to classify sequences into discrete clusters.
